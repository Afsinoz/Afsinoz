I am Afşın (afʃɯn, afshɯn, Afshin, Afsin, etc. Hard to pronounce, right?). I define myself as a software engineer focused on data and AI. Also, I am interested in machine learning and deep learning (Which is a bit general, but meh). Here is my [website](https://afsinoz.com/)  if you want to get more information. If you want to learn about my project by talking with my AI assistant, check [Me but a Chatbot](afsinoz.com/chatbot)

## Data Science Focused Projects

- Prediction models for dissolved oxygen levels in the Ocean with [NewAtlantis](https://www.newatlantis.io/); if you want to check, here is the [link](https://github.com/new-atlantis-labs/na-erdos-fellows-monorepo).

- Created an LLMs pipeline with open Reddit data to answer your questions by only posting on Reddit, [RAG_LLM_Reddit](https://github.com/Afsinoz/RAG_LLM_Reddit).

- [Music Genre Classification](https://github.com/AzizABG/music-genre-classification)

- Interpolation of partially observed sea surface (height value), [OceanImage](https://github.com/Afsinoz/OceanImage)

- Image improvement with proximal operator and wavelet transform, [prox-wavelet](https://github.com/Afsinoz/prox-wavelet)

## More on Software Part

~~I am constantly learning new topics, and am obtaining [IBM DevOps and Sofware Engineering Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/devops-and-software-engineering?).~~

I abandoned IBM DevOps certification because it is mostly AI-read text, which doesn't teach you; you just force yourself to listen to it for long hours. If you want to learn programming (and backend in general), go and check [boot.dev](boot.dev), which is a great platform to learn about this stuff. Also, I am in the community, no they don't pay me (yet).

<!-- - 🌱 Besides the backend programming with Go, I am working on my Data Engineering skills. I am checking the [DataTalks Data Engineering Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp) and preparing my notes when they are ready, there will be in [DataEngineeringLearning](https://github.com/Afsinoz/DataEngineeringLearning) -->

Also, check my current small project(/s),
- [pokedexcli](https://github.com/Afsinoz/pokedexcli). 
- [aggregator](https://github.com/Afsinoz/aggregator), creating databases, web scraping, and more. 
- [Chirpy](https://github.com/Afsinoz/Chirpy), creating a fake Twitter (yes, it is not X).
