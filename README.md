I am Af≈üƒ±n (Af É…Øn, Afsh…Øn, Afshin, Afsin and etc. Hard to pronounce right?), I am interested in Machine learning and Deep learning (It is a bit general but meh). Here is my [website](https://afsinoz.github.io/), if you want to get more information. 

I am currently working on [RAG_LLM_Reddit](https://github.com/Afsinoz/RAG_LLM_Reddit). But I worked on different projects, 
- [Music Genre Classification](https://github.com/AzizABG/music-genre-classification)

- Interpolation of partially observed sea surface (height value), [OceanImage](https://github.com/Afsinoz/OceanImage)

- Image improvement with proximal operator and wavelet transform, [prox-wavelet](https://github.com/Afsinoz/OceanImage)

I am constantly learning new topics and am obtaining [IBM DevOps and Sofware Engineering Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/devops-and-software-engineering?). 

I also appreciate the online learning communities like [skilstak](https://skilstak.io/), [ThePrimeagen](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeagen).
